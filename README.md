### Hello World, I'm Alex Sander

As you can see, my name is Alex Sander. I'm an undergraduate student in physics at the Physics Institute of the University of SÃ£o Paulo (IF-USP) and I'm also a chemical thecnician. I use the coding as a way to doing science and solving (at least try to) some issues that we can wheter or not solve in analitic ways. I hope you enjoy my personal (maybe professional) profile.
